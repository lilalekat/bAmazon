### **Welcome to the bAmazon Store!!!**
___________
### An Amazon-like storefront based off of Node and mySQL. In this CLI app, you can use your precious fingertips to view all available inventory, add your desired Products to your cart, and be presented with your cart Total! </br>
### Remember that the products are available as long as supplies last! So, if a product is no longer in stock, the **bAmazon** app will be sure to let you know! So, sit back, shop til you drop, and **enjoy** our Going Out 'For' Business Sale! :wink:
